Humanity (2019) <br> <br>
             I think that the essence of a rock or stone, is to some degree, that it’s its own body…
Less positive we, humans do not get so lucky.
We need to cope with a soul, a soul that does nog rises like our bodies to plato’s horizon.
Bodies as portals for experiences


Our soul keeps on tracking and today I felt the soul more than ever searching, to a place that doesn’t exists.

We are controlled by our soul.

My soul was hurt and it started to embody my body. First I felt grief.
But the strange thing is that people feel grief when the lose someone, but that is not the care.
Dead is not the worst thing that can happen. Dead is just an evolution of a revolution.


My body starts to tremble- my soul is searching to be absolute.
My soul was infected by matter.

I can not feel things anymore. I feel empty- is emptiness not the absolution (??!…)
My body keeps on tracking and trembling, it van not find exit, so my eyes start crying, crying saltwater.
The salty water evokes my chapped lips.

I feel more alive and dead than I ever felt before. I pain the essence of life? To feel alive? is that the purpose of humanity?

  Breeze ( 2018) <br><br>
  I can feel a cold breeze running past my body when i think of you.

  Just the idea of not being able to touch you makes my mind go crazy,
  I can still remember how your mannners felt.
  I can still remember how you used to shut your eyes a little longer then everyone elese did.
  I  can still feel the touch of your hands.

I feel like a baby who discoverd candy and can't have it anymore, did you know, you where my candy?

There were times where i cried myself to sleep in the darkest of the night.
This week there was no night, my inner child kept on drawning in my own body.
I feel the constant tiredness, every moment of the day.


A little glance in his eyes, reminds me of you. I think thats why i keep on craving to have eye contact with the person.
Not more then five seconds, because then i realise that it's not you.

When i set my feet on the ground, it's like i can feel you walking.
When i'm in my attickroom, it's like i van feel you sleeping
When i see my plants moving, it's like i can feel you breathing
I can geel you everywhere, but i can't touch you.
